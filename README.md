# pokedex

Run locally just clone the repo, install dependencies(flutter pub get) and run (flutter run)

For login you can use any email with valid formate and any password is just for testing purposes.

Packages that I used:

provider: for state management is really simple and convenient for small projects.

shared_preferences: To store locally some settings

http: To make http request to the pokemon API

introduction_screen: To create the onboarding, is easy to implement and very configurable
