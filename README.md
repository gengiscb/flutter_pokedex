# pokedex

Run locally just clone the repo, install dependencies(flutter pub get) and run (flutter run)

Packages that I used:

provider: for state management is really simple and convenient for small projects.

shared_preferences: To store locally some settings

http: To make http request to the pokemon API

introduction_screen: To create the onboarding, is easy to implement and very configurable
